    the hexdump to import the IP addresses are adjusted, transport layer ports
    are adjusted, the TCP window information is adjusted, but still the frames
    originate from the same interface and go to the other interface.
    
    This changes makes it so that the Ethernet destination and source address
    is also adjusted with the direction indicated, to match the other adjusted
    addressing used.

    LISP: Switch to proto_tree_add_subtree_format()
    
    When the LISP dissector was initially written, it followed a different
    pattern for adding subtrees with a text label, which needs to be
    modified while dissecting: proto_tree_add_item() +
    proto_item_append_text() + proto_item_add_subtree().
    
    This commit updates the code to use the more elegant
    proto_tree_add_subtree_format() call.

commit 611d7c8fb2
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Nov 13 19:38:12 2018 -0800

    Catch attempts to write multiple encapsulation types if unsupported.
    
    If, in the process of opening the input file, we determine that it has
    packets of more than one link-layer type, we can catch attempts to write
    that file to a file of a format that doesn't support more than one
    link-layer type at the time we try to open the output file.
    
    If, however, we don't discover that the file has more than one
    link-layer type until we've already created the output file - for
    example, if we have a pcapng file with a new IDB, with a different
    link-layer type from previous IDBs, after packet blocks for the earlier
    interfces - we can't catch that until we try to write the packet.
    
    Currently, that causes the packet's data to be written out as is, so the
    output file claims it's of the file's link-layer type, causing programs
    reading the file to misdissect the packet.

    MMSE: catch length overflows to avoid infinite loop.
    
    After fetching a length from the packet ensure those bytes exist to
    avoid integer overflows by callers (while avoiding having to ensure
    every caller checks for overflows).
    
    Also add a check to ensure the loop in question is progressing through
    the TVB; report a dissector bug if it doesn't.

commit ecca992cfd
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Nov 12 19:38:12 2018 -0800

    Fix dissection of 802.11+radiotap frames in Linux "cooked" captures.
    
    Those frames *don't* have their link-layer headers stripped, even on
    PF_PACKET/SOCK_DGRAM captures (hopefully, nobody will consider that a
    bug and "fix" it).
    
    The "hatype" field is the ARPHRD_ value for the adapter, as returned by
    SIOCGIFHWADDR; in monitor mode, those frames will have an hatype of
    ARPHRD_IEEE80211_RADIOTAP.  Add an "sll.hatype" dissector table, which
    we check before checking the "sll.ltype" dissector table, and have the
    radiotap dissector register in that table.
    
    We still use the special hack for an hatype of ARPHRD_NETLINK, because,
    for *those* frames, the "protocol" field of the nominal SLL header is
    the netlink family, not an Ethertype or anything else that the SLL
    dissector would handle.

    LBMPDM: fix heap-buffer-overflow (write) in dissect_segment_ofstable
    
    id_list and ofs_list contain offsets read directly from the packet.
    While the field type is FT_UINT32, it is somehow interpreted as signed
    number. This means that ofs_table->offset_list[id_list[idx]]=... could
    in fact result in an arbitrary write before "ofs_table->offset_list" due
    to id_list[idx] being negative.
    
    Another way for id_list[idx] to remain negative (-1) is for the loop to
    terminate before all "field_count" elements are set. Thus, remove the
    "datalen_remaining >= L_LBMPDM_OFFSET_ENTRY_T" check, if the offset is
    invalid the proto_tree_add_item accessors will throw an exception.
    
    Fixes the crash in the linked bug. Regression tested against the 8
    capture files from bug 9718, its dissection results are still the same.

Author: Stig Bjørlykke <stig@bjorlykke.org>
Date:   Sun Oct 14 20:22:08 2018 +0200

    extcap: Read stderr on extcap error without an infinite loop
    
    Check if data is available on stderr before doing a blocking read() to
    avoid an infinite read loop when having less data than STDERR_BUFFER_SIZE.
    
    Append data instead of overwrite when doing multiple read() to fetch
    available data.
    
    This is a regression from g6a949ed155.

    Some cleanups.
    
    More use of "UNIX-like" as the term for "macOS and Linux and *BSD and
    Solaris and AIX and..." or, alternatively, for "not Windows".
    
    Add Fedora as a Linux distribution for which packages are available.
    
    Use "Windows" rather than "Win32" in more cases; "Win32" dates back to
    the days when the big difference was between Boring Old 16-bit Windows
    and modern shiny new 32-bit Windows, but the former is now dead and the
    latter now supports both 32-bit and 64-bit machines and software.  More
    people have probably never heard "Win32" but are familiar with
    "Windows".
    
    *ALL* UNIX-like platforms support symlinks; Linux wasn't even the first
    one, it just picked them up from the UN*Xes with which it was trying to
    be compatible.

    DCERPC: simplify pointer list tracking
    
    Observe that the "current_depth" and "len_ndr_pointer_list" just track
    the length of the current singly linked list in order to insert (append)
    or remove [the last] element (a linked list of lists and a linked list
    of pointers respectively). Replace these callers by equivalents that do
    not require explicit length tracking, internally they both have to do a
    O(n) lookup anyway.
    
    There used to be a case where "current_depth" could run out-of-sync, no
    longer tracking the actual list length: when the callback (tnpd->fnct or
    tnpd->callback) triggers an exception. I believe this was unintentional.
    
    No functional change intended, but this should make further changes to
    the data structures easier.

    tvbuff_composite: fix buffer overflow due to wrong offset adjustment
    
    The tvb_offset method should return the offset of the buffer within the
    backing tvb (ds_tvb). The currently returned non-zero offset is valid
    for tvbuff_subset.c, but not for the composite TVB. The backing tvb is
    the tvb itself, so the offset should be zero (or "counter" for
    consistency with tvbuff_real.c and others).
    
    This bug is observable with the capture from the bug. In tshark, the
    data field in the PDML output has value "field length invalid!" and the
    position attribute ("pos") is too large. With the -V option it even
    crashes with a buffer overflow (read). In the GUI, the bytes tab shows
    range 3199-19642 even if the data source is only 16444 bytes while the
    selection should have been 0-16443.

    eap: don't dissect the identity as IMSI unless that's the case.
    
    The identity in SIM/AKA/AKA' is IMSI (permanent identity) in some cases only.
    Others contain a pseudonym or a fast reauthentication username. Dissect the
    formers as flat usernames.

commit 3e6de6d5f2
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Oct 11 22:12:29 2018 -0700

    Clean up MSVC version string generation.
    
    Don't bother with versions prior to VS 2010; as of Wireshark 2.4, we
    don't support them.
    
    Show it as "Visual Studio (year)", followed by the toolchain version
    (not to be confused with the compiler version - or with the Visual
    Studio version!).
    
    Do the same thing for the clang/C2 compiler; just append the clang
    version stuff after that.
    
    Indent the #if/#elif/#else/#endif to make it a little clearer how
    they're nested.
